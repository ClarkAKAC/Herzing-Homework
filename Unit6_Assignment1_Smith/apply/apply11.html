            In today's economy building up your credit may seem complicated or difficult, but I am here 
            to simplify this for you. The first thing that helps establish credit is getting a secured 
            credit card with your bank. Many people make the mistake of getting a credit card with just 
            any random bank, but there two distinct advantages to getting your first credit card with your 
            bank. The first big advantage is that your bank will typically give you a higher credit limit 
            than a random bank would be willing to give you. The increased limit might be just enough to 
            save you in the event of an emergency. The second major advantage is much rarer, but it is 
            certainly as helpful. Although it is uncommon, some banks are willing to give out a lower 
            interest rate to clients that have been with them for an extended period of time. If you are 
            lucky enough to have this happen, it can end up saving you a significant amount of money.

            At this point, you may be wondering why you should use a secured credit card, or even what
            a secured credit card is. A secured credit card is a credit card where the limit is determined
            by the size of the security deposit you give for the card. This deposit is important because it
            reduces the risk that a credit agency or bank normally takes on from new clients. If a the credit
            agency does not view you as a risk, they will have no reason to deny your application for a card.

            Once you have obtained your secured credit card, follow these steps below to start building credt.

        <ul>
            <li>Make regular purchases every month. Credit agencies want to see that you can use the credit
                card without going overboard.</li>
            <li>Keep your credit card balance at or under 10% of your total spending limit for the card.</li>
            <li>Ensure that all monthly payments on the card are on time. If you miss one, this is permanently
                recorded in your credit history against your credit score.
            </li>
